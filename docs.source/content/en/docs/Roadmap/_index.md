(To be determined)

- Assist generating mTLS certs?
- Launch a virtual DNS when `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` is granted, and add the DNS to `/etc/resolv.conf` when the file is writable? (writable by default in Docker and Kubernetes)
- Create Kubernetes `Services`?
- Detect port numbers automatically by watching `/proc/net/tcp`, and propagate the information across the cluster automatically?
