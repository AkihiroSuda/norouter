- [vdeplug4](https://github.com/rd235/vdeplug4): vdeplug4 can create ad-hoc L2 networks over stdio.
  vdeplug4 is similar to NoRouter in the sense that it uses stdio, but vdeplug4 requires privileges (at least in userNS) for creating TAP devices.
- [telepresence](https://www.telepresence.io/): kube-only and needs privileges
